<h1>My top movies of all time - Chuito</h1>
<h2>This is an amateur review</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Pianist</h3>
<p>The best movie I have ever watched because it combines history, drama, and an example of resilience</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>A +18 movie with a funny way of showing excesses, but still showing the power of resilience and entrepreneurship</p>
<h3>Bolivar: The Liberator</h3>
<p>This movie takes me all the way to review the history of my home country</p>
